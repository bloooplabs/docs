# Web Dashboard

The Blooop dashboard is the primary orchestration interface for managing your agents, infrastructure, and execution environments.

It provides full visibility and control over autonomous operations.

---

## Overview

From the dashboard, users can:

- Deploy agents
- Install skills
- Monitor execution
- Manage wallets
- Configure permissions
- Review analytics

It acts as the operating console for your agent infrastructure.

---

## Agent Management

The dashboard allows you to deploy and manage multiple agents.

### Capabilities

- Deploy new agents
- Pause or stop execution
- Restart runtime environments
- Monitor agent health
- View execution logs

Agents can run independently or in coordinated systems.

---

## Skill Installation

Agents gain functionality through skills.

The dashboard provides access to the skill marketplace.

### Actions

- Browse available skills
- Install or uninstall modules
- Configure skill parameters
- Update skill versions

Skills extend what agents are capable of executing.

---

## Execution Monitoring

The dashboard provides real-time visibility into agent activity.

### Monitoring includes

- Active workflows
- Decision triggers
- Transaction execution
- Task completion logs
- Error reporting

Users can audit agent behavior at all times.

---

## Wallet Management

Agents operate with controlled wallets.

The dashboard enables:

- Wallet creation
- Balance monitoring
- Transaction history
- Spend configuration
- Approval rule setup

All financial actions remain permissioned.

---

## Permission Controls

Users define how agents execute actions.

Permission settings include:

- Spend limits
- Approval thresholds
- Execution scopes
- Skill authorization
- Emergency overrides

This ensures autonomy operates within defined boundaries.

---

## Infrastructure Controls

Users can manage compute environments directly.

### Controls include

- Resource allocation
- Runtime scaling
- Environment resets
- Deployment regions

Infrastructure remains abstracted but configurable.

---

## Analytics & Insights

The dashboard aggregates operational data.

### Insights include

- Agent performance metrics
- Execution frequency
- Skill utilization
- Transaction volumes

This enables optimization of agent strategies.

---

## Multi-Agent Orchestration

Blooop supports coordinated agent systems.

The dashboard enables:

- Agent grouping
- Task routing
- Capability delegation
- Execution hierarchies

Agents can collaborate toward shared objectives.

---

## Summary

The Blooop dashboard acts as the control tower for autonomous operations — enabling deployment, monitoring, execution control, and infrastructure management from a unified interface.
