# Marketplace

The Blooop Marketplace is the capability distribution layer for AI agents.

It enables users to discover, install, and monetize modular skills that extend agent functionality.

Agents are not static — they evolve through capabilities.

---

## What Are Skills?

Skills are modular extensions that define what agents can do.

Without skills, agents have limited execution ability.

Skills enable agents to:

- Execute trades
- Analyze markets
- Interact with APIs
- Manage on-chain assets
- Automate workflows
- Perform commerce actions

They function like applications installed on an operating system.

---

## Skill Architecture

Skills are designed to be:

- Modular
- Composable
- Upgradeable
- Permissioned

This allows agents to stack multiple capabilities simultaneously.

---

## Skill Installation

Users install skills directly from the marketplace.

Installation includes:

- Capability provisioning
- Permission configuration
- Execution scope definition

Skills activate immediately once installed.

---

## Monetization Layer

The marketplace creates an economy for developers.

Skill creators can:

- Publish capabilities
- Monetize installations
- Charge usage fees
- Earn execution royalties

Developers become infrastructure providers for agent capabilities.

---

## Discovery Layer

Users can search for skills based on capabilities.

Examples:

- “Find a trading arbitrage skill.”
- “Install NFT pricing analytics.”
- “Enable treasury risk management.”

Capability discovery replaces app discovery.

---

## Permission & Security

Skills operate within defined permission boundaries.

Controls include:

- Wallet access restrictions
- Spend limits
- Execution approvals
- Data access scopes

No skill can operate outside authorized permissions.

---

## Capability Composability

Agents can combine multiple skills into unified workflows.

Examples:

- Analytics skill detects opportunity
- Trading skill executes position
- Risk skill monitors exposure

Multi-skill orchestration enables complex automation.

---

## Marketplace Flywheel

The marketplace grows through ecosystem participation:

1. Developers publish skills  
2. Users install capabilities  
3. Agents execute workflows  
4. Developers earn revenue  
5. More skills are created  

This expands agent functionality exponentially.

## Summary

The Blooop Marketplace transforms agents from static entities into evolving autonomous systems — powered by modular capabilities and developer-driven innovation.
