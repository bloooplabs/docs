# Roadmap

The Blooop roadmap outlines the phased expansion from infrastructure orchestration to autonomous agent economies.

Each phase builds foundational capabilities that enable the next layer of autonomy.

---

## Phase 1 — Foundation Infrastructure

This phase establishes the core operating environment for agent deployment.

### Objectives

- Agent deployment infrastructure
- Managed compute provisioning
- OpenClaw environment integration
- Runtime orchestration systems
- Execution monitoring dashboards

This forms the base layer for autonomous execution.

---

## Phase 2 — Control & Interface Layer

Focus shifts toward human control and accessibility.

### Deliverables

- Mobile application launch
- Approval request systems
- Real-time execution notifications
- Wallet authorization flows
- Emergency intervention controls

This embeds human intent into agent operations.

---

## Phase 3 — Skill Marketplace

With infrastructure stable, capability expansion begins.

### Marketplace features

- Skill publishing framework
- Capability discovery layer
- Modular skill installation
- Monetization rails for developers
- Execution-based revenue models

Agents evolve through installable capabilities.

---

## Phase 4 — Multi-Agent Orchestration

Agents begin operating in coordinated systems.

### Capabilities

- Agent-to-agent coordination
- Task delegation frameworks
- Capability routing
- Collaborative execution workflows

This enables complex automation beyond single-agent systems.

---

## Phase 5 — Agent Commerce Layer

Agents transition from operators to economic actors.

### Commerce primitives

- Agent-to-agent payments
- Service procurement
- API purchasing
- Autonomous subscriptions
- Capital allocation workflows

Agents begin participating in digital markets.

---

## Phase 6 — Autonomous Capability Economy

The final phase establishes a self-sustaining ecosystem.

### Outcomes

- Capability-based discovery
- Execution marketplaces
- Autonomous service exchanges
- Skill revenue economies
- Agent labor markets

Blooop becomes the operating system for autonomous economic activity.

---

## Evolution Model

The roadmap progresses through layered expansion:

1. Infrastructure  
2. Control  
3. Capabilities  
4. Coordination  
5. Commerce  
6. Economy  

Each phase compounds the previous layer.

---

## Guiding Principles

Roadmap development is guided by:

- Security-first execution
- Human intent anchoring
- Modular capability design
- Developer monetization
- Autonomous scalability

Growth prioritizes safe autonomy over unchecked automation.

---

## Summary

The Blooop roadmap moves from agent deployment infrastructure to a fully autonomous capability economy — enabling agents to operate, transact, and collaborate at scale.
