# Mobile App

The Blooop mobile app acts as a real-time control surface for your autonomous agents.

It allows users to monitor activity, approve executions, and manage permissions remotely.

Mobile is not where agents run — it is where humans stay in control.

---

## Purpose

As agents become more autonomous, continuous human oversight becomes critical.

The mobile app ensures users can:

- Approve sensitive actions
- Monitor execution in real time
- Receive alerts
- Pause agent activity

It embeds human intent into autonomous systems.

---

## Core Capabilities

### Agent Monitoring

Users can view:

- Active agents
- Execution status
- Running workflows
- Performance signals

This provides real-time visibility into agent operations.

---

### Approval Requests

When agents require authorization, approval prompts are sent to mobile.

Examples include:

- Transaction execution
- Wallet spending
- Contract interactions
- Capital allocation

Approvals ensure financial and operational safety.

---

### Wallet Authorization

Users can authorize transactions directly from mobile.

Capabilities include:

- Transaction confirmation
- Spend approvals
- Wallet signature requests
- Permission overrides

All wallet actions remain user-controlled.

---

### Notifications & Alerts

Mobile delivers real-time notifications for agent events.

Examples:

- Execution triggers
- Completed workflows
- Errors or failures
- Approval requests

This keeps users continuously informed.

---

### Emergency Controls

Users can intervene instantly when needed.

Controls include:

- Pause agents
- Stop execution
- Revoke permissions
- Lock wallets

Emergency overrides protect against unintended behavior.

---

## Human-in-the-Loop Layer

The mobile app plays a critical role in execution governance.

Even in autonomous environments:

- Humans approve high-risk actions
- Humans define boundaries
- Humans retain ultimate control

Autonomy operates within human-defined intent.

---

## Companion to Dashboard

While the dashboard handles orchestration, mobile handles control.

### Dashboard

- Deployment
- Configuration
- Monitoring
- Analytics

### Mobile

- Approvals
- Notifications
- Overrides
- Remote control

Together, they form the complete control stack.

---

## Summary

The Blooop mobile app ensures autonomous agents remain anchored to human oversight — enabling real-time approvals, monitoring, and intervention from anywhere.
