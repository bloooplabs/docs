# User Flow

This page outlines the complete lifecycle of how users interact with Blooop — from onboarding to autonomous agent execution.

Blooop is designed to abstract infrastructure complexity while preserving human control.

---

## 1 — Account Creation

Users begin by creating an account.

### Authentication options

- Email (SSO)
- Wallet login
- OAuth providers

This identity anchors agent ownership, infrastructure, and permissions.

---

## 2 — Infrastructure Provisioning

Before agents can run, compute environments must be provisioned.

Blooop handles:

- Server allocation
- Container orchestration
- Runtime configuration
- Network setup

Users select infrastructure based on required performance and scale.

---

## 3 — OpenClaw Deployment

Once infrastructure is active, OpenClaw is deployed automatically.

Deployment includes:

- Agent runtime installation
- Dependency setup
- Environment configuration
- Multi-agent orchestration readiness

This establishes the agent execution layer.

---

## 4 — Agent Installation

Users can now deploy agents into their environment.

### Agent examples

- Trading agents
- Monitoring agents
- Research agents
- Commerce agents

Agents operate independently or in coordinated systems.

---

## 5 — Skill Installation

Agents gain functionality through modular skills.

Skills define what agents can do.

### Examples

- Execute trades
- Analyze markets
- Interact with APIs
- Manage on-chain positions
- Automate workflows

Skills are installed via the marketplace.

---

## 6 — Wallet & Permission Setup

Agents require wallets to transact and execute financial actions.

Blooop enables:

- Agent wallet generation
- Spending limits
- Approval thresholds
- Transaction policies

All wallets remain user-controlled.

---

## 7 — Execution Model Configuration

Users define how autonomous agents can operate.

Execution models:

- **Human-in-the-loop** — requires approvals
- **Rule-based** — operates within limits
- **Fully autonomous** — executes independently

Execution permissions define trust and risk boundaries.

---

## 8 — Agent Activation

Once configured, agents can be launched.

Upon activation, agents begin:

- Monitoring conditions
- Making decisions
- Executing actions
- Coordinating with other agents

All activity is logged and observable.

---

## 9 — Monitoring & Control

Users monitor agents through:

### Dashboard

- Execution logs
- Performance analytics
- Wallet activity
- Skill operations

### Mobile App

- Approval requests
- Notifications
- Emergency stops
- Execution overrides

Mobile acts as the human control surface.

## Lifecycle Summary

End-to-end flow:

1. Create account  
2. Provision infrastructure  
3. Deploy OpenClaw  
4. Install agents  
5. Install skills  
6. Configure wallets  
7. Define execution permissions  
8. Launch agents  
9. Monitor & control  

Blooop enables autonomous execution while preserving human intent at every critical layer.
