# Tokenomics

Blooop tokenomics is designed to bootstrap a real agent economy —  
where operators run agents, developers publish skills, and usage generates sustainable value across the ecosystem.

The goal is simple:

> Reward real activity. Fund real infrastructure. Align long-term incentives.

---

## Token Overview

- **Token:** $BLP  
- **Type:** Utility + ecosystem coordination  
- **Supply model:** Fixed cap  
- **Primary role:** Incentives, marketplace coordination, and ecosystem funding  

$BLP exists to power the economic layer of Blooop — not to replace product value, but to accelerate it.

---

## Total Supply

**1,000,000,000 BLP** (fixed cap)

No hidden minting functions or inflation beyond predefined allocations.

Future governance may adjust emissions pacing — but never the max supply cap.

---

## Launch Platform

$BLP was launched via **Pump.fun** as an initial liquidity and distribution mechanism.

This launch model enabled:

- Open market participation from day one  
- Fair bonding-curve price discovery  
- Rapid community distribution  
- Transparent early liquidity formation

This page serves as the primary public market reference during the early lifecycle of $BLP.

## Creator Rewards → Ecosystem Funding

Creator rewards generated during the Pump.fun lifecycle are allocated toward building the Blooop ecosystem.

These rewards are not extracted as profit — they are reinvested into product and infrastructure development.

### Primary funding areas:

- Blooop mobile app development  
- Dashboard & web platform  
- Blooop Cloud infrastructure  
- Agent orchestration systems  
- Security audits & infra costs  

In short:

> Market participation directly funds ecosystem development.

## Allocation

| Bucket | Allocation | Purpose |
|---|---:|---|
| Community & User Rewards | 35% | Operator incentives, early adopters, ecosystem growth |
| Ecosystem & Builder Incentives | 20% | Skill developers, grants, marketplace growth |
| Core Contributors | 18% | Team & long-term builders |
| Strategic Backers | 15% | Partnerships & early supporters |
| Treasury / Foundation | 10% | Security, infra, audits, operations |
| Liquidity & Market Making | 2% | Launch liquidity & stabilization |

Allocations are structured to prioritize ecosystem growth over short-term extraction.

---

## Vesting Structure

| Bucket | Cliff | Vesting |
|---|---:|---:|
| Core Contributors | 12 months | 36 months linear |
| Strategic Backers | 6 months | 24 months linear |
| Treasury | None | Controlled releases |
| Community Rewards | None | Emitted via programs |

Long vesting ensures builders remain aligned with long-term ecosystem health.

---

## Emissions & Incentives

BLP emissions are tied to ecosystem activity — not arbitrary inflation.

### Operator Incentives

Reward users who:

- Deploy agents  
- Maintain uptime  
- Execute real workloads  
- Contribute to network activity  

### Builder Incentives

Reward developers who:

- Publish skills  
- Drive installs & retention  
- Generate marketplace revenue  
- Maintain security standards  

### Growth Incentives

Includes:

- Referrals  
- Early adopter rewards  
- Ecosystem campaigns  

All incentives prioritize meaningful usage over vanity metrics.

---

## Marketplace Economics

Blooop operates a skill marketplace where developers monetize agent capabilities.

### Example fee flow (draft model)

- 70% → Skill developer  
- 20% → Treasury  
- 10% → Burn / buyback / sinks  

This creates sustainable funding while rewarding builders.

---

## Token Sinks

To maintain long-term balance, BLP integrates usage sinks:

- Skill marketplace fees  
- Deployment discounts via BLP payments  
- Builder staking requirements  
- Visibility boosts & listing bonds  
- Potential buyback / burn mechanisms  

Sinks scale with ecosystem usage — not speculation cycles.

---

## Governance Scope

BLP governance may oversee:

- Marketplace parameters  
- Emissions tuning  
- Treasury allocation  
- Security funding  
- Listing standards  

Governance is designed to be slow, transparent, and security-first.

---

## Economic Philosophy

Blooop tokenomics follows three core principles:

**1. Usage > speculation**  
Rewards come from real agent activity.

**2. Builders earn when users win**  
Skills monetize only when they create value.

**3. Infrastructure comes first**  
Treasury prioritizes security, infra, and sustainability.

---

## Transparency

Blooop aims to provide visibility into:

- Treasury flows  
- Reward emissions  
- Ecosystem funding usage  
- Security spending  

Transparency expands as the ecosystem matures.

---

## TL;DR

- Fixed supply: 1B $BLP  
- Launched via Pump.fun  
- Creator rewards fund Blooop development  
- Incentives reward operators & builders  
- Marketplace fees create sustainable sinks  
- Governance steers long-term growth  

BLP is the coordination layer of the Blooop agent economy.
