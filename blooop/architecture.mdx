# Architecture

Blooop is designed as a layered orchestration operating system for autonomous agents.

Each layer abstracts complexity while preserving modular control and scalability.

---

## System Overview

Blooop consists of five core layers:

1. Infrastructure Layer  
2. Agent Layer  
3. Skill Layer  
4. Wallet & Permission Layer  
5. Interface Layer  

Together, these layers enable secure and scalable autonomous execution.

---

## 1 — Infrastructure Layer

The infrastructure layer provides the compute environments where agents operate.

### Responsibilities

- Server provisioning
- Container orchestration
- Resource allocation
- Runtime isolation
- Network configuration

Each user operates within their own isolated agent environment.

---

## Compute Model

Blooop supports:

- Managed cloud environments
- Scalable compute allocation
- Multi-agent runtime containers

This ensures agents can execute continuously without manual maintenance.

---

## 2 — Agent Layer

The agent layer is powered by the OpenClaw framework.

It handles agent execution, coordination, and lifecycle management.

### Capabilities

- Multi-agent deployment
- Task execution engines
- Decision logic frameworks
- Agent-to-agent coordination

Agents operate as autonomous software entities within their environments.

---

## 3 — Skill Layer

Skills define agent capabilities.

They act as modular extensions that agents can install and execute.

### Skill categories

- Trading execution
- Market analytics
- Commerce automation
- API integrations
- On-chain interactions
- Workflow automation

Skills are composable, enabling agents to evolve capabilities over time.

---

## Skill Marketplace

Developers can publish skills into the ecosystem.

This creates a capability marketplace where:

- Skills can be discovered
- Installed on demand
- Monetized by creators

Blooop becomes a distribution layer for agent functionality.

---

## 4 — Wallet & Permission Layer

Agents require wallets to transact and execute economic actions.

Blooop implements a controlled execution wallet model.

### Features

- Agent wallet generation
- User-owned custody
- Spending limits
- Approval thresholds
- Transaction policies

Wallet actions are gated by human-defined permissions.

---

## Human Intent Enforcement

Autonomy is constrained by intent.

Security controls include:

- Approval requests
- Spend caps
- Execution rules
- Emergency stops

No financial action occurs outside defined permission boundaries.

---

## 5 — Interface Layer

The interface layer connects users to their agents.

### Web Dashboard

- Agent deployment
- Skill installation
- Execution monitoring
- Wallet management
- Analytics & logs

### Mobile App

- Approval requests
- Notifications
- Transaction authorization
- Agent monitoring

Mobile acts as a real-time control surface.

---

## Layer Interaction Flow

Execution lifecycle:

1. Infrastructure provisions runtime  
2. Agents deploy into environment  
3. Skills extend agent capabilities  
4. Wallets enable transactions  
5. Interfaces provide human control  

Each layer operates independently yet cohesively.

---

## Architectural Principles

Blooop architecture is designed around:

- Modularity
- Isolation
- Permissioned execution
- User ownership
- Scalable orchestration

This ensures autonomous systems remain controllable and secure.

---

## Summary

Blooop’s architecture transforms fragmented agent tooling into a unified operating system — enabling deployment, coordination, and execution of autonomous agents at scale.
