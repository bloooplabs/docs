# Security

Security within Blooop is designed around a single principle:

Autonomy must operate within human-defined intent.

As agents gain the ability to transact, allocate capital, and coordinate actions, security becomes foundational to safe execution.

---

## Security Philosophy

Blooop does not treat agents as trusted actors by default.

Instead, it enforces:

- Explicit permissions
- Controlled execution
- Financial safeguards
- Human approval layers

Agents operate with capability — but never without constraint.

---

## Wallet Ownership Model

Agents require wallets to perform economic actions.

Blooop implements a user-owned custody model.

### Key principles

- Wallets are user-controlled
- Agents are permissioned operators
- Funds remain under user authority
- Execution requires defined approvals

Agents do not “own” funds — they operate within delegated authority.

---

## Permission Framework

Permissions define what agents are allowed to do.

### Configurable controls

- Spending limits
- Asset exposure caps
- Transaction types
- Contract interaction scopes
- Skill authorization

Permissions ensure agents cannot exceed predefined boundaries.

---

## Approval Layers

Sensitive actions require explicit human authorization.

Approval prompts are triggered for:

- High-value transactions
- Treasury allocation
- Smart contract execution
- Cross-chain transfers

Approvals can be executed via dashboard or mobile app.

---

## Execution Constraints

Agents operate within policy-defined constraints.

Constraints include:

- Daily spending caps
- Transaction frequency limits
- Execution timing windows
- Risk exposure thresholds

Execution halts when constraints are exceeded.

---

## Human Intent Enforcement

Blooop embeds human intent directly into execution logic.

Intent enforcement mechanisms:

- Approval gating
- Wallet signature requests
- Spend confirmations
- Permission escalation prompts

Autonomy cannot bypass human-defined rules.

---

## Emergency Controls

Users can intervene instantly if needed.

Emergency capabilities include:

- Pause agents
- Terminate execution
- Lock wallets
- Revoke permissions

These controls protect against unintended behavior.

---

## Skill Security Isolation

Skills operate within restricted environments.

Security isolation ensures:

- Limited wallet access
- Scoped execution rights
- Controlled data permissions

No skill can access capabilities outside its authorization scope.

---

## Auditability & Transparency

All agent activity is logged and observable.

Users can review:

- Transaction history
- Execution logs
- Skill actions
- Approval records

Transparency ensures accountability across autonomous workflows.

---

## Security Stack Summary

Blooop security combines:

- User-owned wallets
- Permission frameworks
- Approval layers
- Execution constraints
- Emergency overrides
- Activity auditing

This creates a controlled environment where autonomous agents can operate safely.

---

## Closing Principle

Blooop does not remove humans from execution — it embeds them at the intent layer, ensuring autonomy remains aligned with user authority.
