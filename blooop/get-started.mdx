# Get Started

This guide walks you through deploying and running your first AI agent on Blooop.

Blooop abstracts infrastructure complexity so you can focus on configuring agent capabilities rather than managing environments.

---

## Step 1 — Create Your Account

Sign up using:

- Email (SSO)
- Wallet login
- OAuth providers

Once authenticated, you’ll gain access to the Blooop dashboard.

---

## Step 2 — Provision Infrastructure

Before deploying agents, you need compute infrastructure.

Blooop provides managed environments where agents run securely.

### Actions

- Select infrastructure plan
- Allocate compute resources
- Initialize environment

This creates your personal agent runtime.

---

## Step 3 — Deploy OpenClaw

Blooop integrates directly with the OpenClaw framework.

### Deployment includes:

- Agent runtime installation
- Environment configuration
- Container provisioning
- Network initialization

Deployment typically completes within minutes.

---

## Step 4 — Install Your First Agent

Once OpenClaw is active, you can deploy agents.

### Examples

- Trading agents
- Monitoring agents
- Commerce agents
- Automation agents

Agents can run individually or as coordinated systems.

---

## Step 5 — Install Skills

Agents gain capabilities through modular skills.

### Skill categories

- Trading execution
- Market analysis
- API integrations
- Automation workflows
- On-chain interactions

Skills are installable via the marketplace.

---

## Step 6 — Configure Wallets

Agents require wallets to transact.

Blooop enables:

- Agent wallet creation
- Spending permissions
- Approval thresholds
- Execution limits

Wallet control remains user-owned.

---

## Step 7 — Set Execution Permissions

Define how autonomous your agents can operate.

Execution models include:

- Human-in-the-loop
- Rule-based autonomy
- Fully autonomous execution

Permissions determine risk surface.

---

## Step 8 — Launch Agents

Once configured:

- Activate agents
- Monitor execution
- Review logs
- Adjust permissions

Agents begin operating based on configured skills and rules.

---

## Mobile Control

You can connect the mobile app to:

- Receive approval requests
- Authorize transactions
- Monitor agent status
- Pause execution

Mobile acts as your remote control layer.

---

## Summary

By completing these steps, you have:

- Deployed infrastructure
- Installed OpenClaw
- Launched agents
- Configured skills
- Secured wallets
- Defined execution permissions

You are now operating autonomous software on Blooop.
